# Pattern Lab Theme

# Setup

    npm install
    cd pattern-lab
    composer install

Additionally, the [`components` Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) must be enabled:

    drush dl components
    drush en components -y

## Commands

Compile the site:

    npm run compile

Start up watches and local server:

    npm run start

Run Tests:

    npm run test

## Configuration

It's almost all done in `config.yml`. End all paths with a `/` please (i.e. `path/to/dir/`). The local `gulpfile.js` passes the `config` object to [`p2-theme-core`](https://github.com/phase2/p2-theme-core) - which can be viewed at `node_modules/p2-theme-core/` (most stuff in `lib/`).

Documentation for many of the features are found in `node_modules/p2-theme-core/docs/` â€“ those are [hosted here](http://p2-theme-core.readthedocs.org) too.

### Linting Config

- Scss: edit `.sass-lint.yml` - [rule docs](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/master/docs/rules)

## More control

The `npm run` commands above basically trigger gulp without having to install a global dependency. For fine grained control of tasks, install gulp globally with `npm install --global gulp` and then run `gulp help` for a list of all available tasks.

Add anything to `gulpfile.js` that you want! Also, you can copy any file from `node_modules/p2-theme-core/lib/` into your repo and use it as a starting point (may need to install packages from `p2-theme-core` too.)

Many of the features can be turned off, for example if we didn't want all the JS features like linting and concatenation, just toggle `enabled` under `js` in `config.yml`. So you'd just open `config.yml` and change this:

```diff
js:
-    enabled: true
+    enabled: false
```
