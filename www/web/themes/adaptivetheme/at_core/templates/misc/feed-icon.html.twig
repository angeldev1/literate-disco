 *
 * Available variables:
 * - url: An internal system path or a fully qualified external URL of the feed.
 * - icon: The rendered HTML (<img> tag) for the default system feed icon image.
 * - attributes: Remaining HTML attributes for the feed link.
 *   - title: A descriptive title of the feed link.
 *   - class: HTML classes to be applied to the feed link.
